This is a really packed release, that was almost 2 months in the making. The highlight of this release is probably the new design/UX improvements ([see screenshots](https://github.com/getredash/redash/pull/984)) but also includes:

* Shared/public dashboards: you can now generate a secret link, that allows access to a single dashboard (similar to how shareable links work for Google Docs).
* Dashboards the user doesn't have access to any of their widgets are no longer shown to him.
* New admin views to show currently executing queries.
* DynamoDB support.
* Better full screen view for dashboards.
* Ability to receive a password reset link by email.
* Improvements and fixes to the InfluxDB, TreasureData, Impala, Vertica , Sqlite and MongoDB query runners.
* Documentation improvements and more.

## Backward Incompatible Changes

We added few more permissions, enabling more granular control over what a user can do. If you're using custom groups and not all of your users are members of the default group, you might need to manually update your group permissions list.

## How to upgrade?

See [documentation](http://docs.redash.io/en/latest/upgrade.html).
