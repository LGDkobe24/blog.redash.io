This is a hotfix for a memory  usage issue: due to a stupid bug, we were not removing some unused objects from Redis, which results in ever increasing memory usage.

This is a backport of [pull request #1064](https://github.com/getredash/redash/pull/1064) from v0.11.0 to v0.10.0. Upgrading to this release will stop the memory usage increase, but if you want to cleanup Redis you can use the following script:

```python
from redash import redis_connection

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for k in redis_connection.keys('query_task_tracker:*'):
        if redis_connection.zscore('query_task_trackers:done', k) is None and redis_connection.zscore('query_task_trackers:waiting', k) is None and redis_connection.zscore('query_task_trackers:in_progress', k) is None:
            redis_connection.delete(k)
```

This script is not efficient, but will do the job. Note that it supposed to be run from your Redash directory (usually `/opt/redash/current`) using the `bin/run` utility.
