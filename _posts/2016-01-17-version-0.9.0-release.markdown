This version includes a significant refactor and update of the permissions system (check pull request #724 for details) and some backward incompatible changes (see below). I recommend to be extra cautious when upgrading -- make sure it's not peak hour of usage and that you have a backup.

Also in this version we replaced the HighCharts charting library with Plot.ly's library, as the former wasn't open source.

While I'm usually online on our [Slack channel](http://slack.redash.io), I'll also be available specifically for upgrade questions & help during the following "office hours":

* [Monday 18/1 20:00-22:00 UTC](http://time.is/2000_18_Jan_2016_in_UTC) (click on the link to see it in your time zone)
* [Tuesday 19/1 11:00-13:00 UTC](http://time.is/1100_19_Jan_2016_in_UTC)

I will post additional office hours on here and [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/getredash).

If anything isn't clear, don't hesitate to reach out over Slack, Google Groups or just leave here a comment. Also "private support" options are available (details TBD).
